#!/bin/bash

# Update system
sudo apt update

# Install git
sudo apt install git -y

# Install maven

====================================================

Sure! Here's a shell script that installs git and maven on an Ubuntu machine. It also checks if maven is already installed and prints its version if it is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if git is installed
if ! command -v git &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Installing git..."
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y git
    echo "Git installed successfully!"
else
    echo "Git is already installed"
fi

# Check if maven is installed
if command -v mvn &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Maven is already installed"
    mvn --version
else
    echo "Installing maven..."
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y maven
    echo "Maven installed successfully!"
fi
```

Save the above script in a file, for example, `install_git_maven.sh`. Make the script executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install_git_maven.sh
```

Then, you can run the script using the following command:

```bash
./install_git_maven.sh
```

The script will install git and maven if they are not already installed, and it will print the maven version if it is installed.

====================================
Certainly! Let's simplify the explanation:

In Linux, when a command is executed, it produces two types of output:
1. Standard Output (stdout): This is the normal output of a command, which is usually displayed on the terminal.
2. Standard Error (stderr): This is the error output of a command, which is used to display error messages or warnings.

The `&> /dev/null` part of the command is a redirection operator that redirects both stdout and stderr to a special device file called `/dev/null`.

Now, what is `/dev/null`?
- `/dev/null` is a special device file in Linux that discards anything written to it. It acts like a black hole for data. Any data redirected to `/dev/null` is effectively thrown away and not displayed anywhere.

So, when we use `&> /dev/null` in the command, it means that we are redirecting both the normal output (stdout) and error output (stderr) of the command to `/dev/null`, which effectively discards them. This is useful when we don't want to see the output or error messages of a command and just want to silently perform an action without cluttering the terminal.

In the context of the script, `&> /dev/null` is used to suppress any output or error messages from the `command -v` check. It ensures that the check is performed silently, without displaying any unnecessary information to the user.
